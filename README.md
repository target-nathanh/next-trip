# NextTrip: A Nextrip Project

Based on the [NexTrip app](https://www.metrotransit.org/nextripbadge.aspx) by Metro Transit,
this app was built using the Create React App project and uses TypeScript

##Running the app

### `npm install`

After installing your dependencies you can run the app using:

##Assumptions during development

1. Large companies like target often make use of component libraries, so I did as well for this project
2. IE11 would be the oldest browser I would try to target
